## **What is ASpeLl?**

ASpeLl is an app designed to help new Americal Sign Language (ASL) signers practice their signing and comprehension of the alphabet/finger spelling and help them learn some very basic signs. This app is **NOT** designed to be a replacement for an ASL class. ASL classes contain a lot of very useful information (A lot more signs, signing etiquette and grammar, information about deaf culture, etc) and you are highly encouraged to take an ASL class. This app is designed to be a practice resource to help improve (mostly finger spelling) skills.

## **Background**

Avery is a college student at Appalachian State University studying a major in computer science and a minor in American Sign Language. Avery, when encountered with a problem, often attempts to make a computer program to help solve the problem. In this case, the problem is they haven't done any signing in at least a year, and they are enrolled in an ASL 3 class. To practice their signing they turned to sites like [asl.ms](https://asl.ms) This site is an amazing resource but is not optimized to work well on a mobile device. This got annoying to Avery, so they set out to make their own version, hence, ASpeLl.

## **How is this project done?**

This is an open-source project, go check out the code! You can check out the source code at (https://github.com/KittKat7/ASpeLl) or the current webapp code at (https://github.com/KittKat7/ASpeLl-app). This app is programmed in the flutter framework (using dart as its language). The reason for flutter was to write the source code only once and have it be able to run on most common devices, IE: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, IOS, and Web.
